🚀 Revolutionizing the Energy Drink Market: A Marketing Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge on marketing analysis in the F&B Marketing domain. In this project, we dive into the dynamic world of energy drinks in India, focusing on CodeX, a German beverage company, and their recently launched energy drink in 10 cities across the country.

🌟 The Challenge

As a part of the marketing team at CodeX, I had the incredible opportunity to conduct a comprehensive survey in these cities. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights that would aid in increasing brand awareness, market share, and driving product development. The survey data, coupled with a range of powerful tools, formed the basis for our analysis and actionable strategies.

🔍 Approach & Tools

Throughout the project, I utilized a combination of Excel and Power Query for data cleaning and merging. To visualize the data and present key findings, I leveraged PowerBI to create insightful visuals like column charts, bar charts, and donut charts. The presentation was enhanced using Canva, and engaging videos were created with Zoom and hosted on YouTube.
